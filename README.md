# ELK app

This repository does not contain the code (the actual code can be found in a private repo that is in the deployment phase). 

The screenshots show some of the boards of the application which is an educational game which is a startup project. 

My contribution consisted of designing the graphical side of the application, responsive layout, writing the code for 7 educational games and integration with the backend.

Application is fully responsive.
